# README for Validator

## About

## How to use

## Notes

* store the graphs from the validation in lancedb and then process to quads for loading into a graph from there.  
* Or use pyoxigraph from the start?
* A table format for use in KuzuDB?   nice for analytics and path analysis

## Rust option

Lincoln institute, Internet of Water, is using:

https://github.com/rudof-project/rudof?tab=readme-ov-file

This is work checking out.  May need https://lib.rs/crates/rdftk_core to provide
Skolemization.  Though I don't see it in there nor in rudof.   Without that, 
it's a bit hard to move over, though it's not an impossible bit of logic 
to do in Rust.
