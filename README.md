# Qlever Test Instance

## About

First, if you are interested in Qlever and running it locally, DO NOT USE THIS REPO.  At least, it's very likely this is
not what you want.

You likely want to go to the [qlever-control](https://github.com/ad-freiburg/qlever-control) repo instead.  That
is the official repo for a nice server and UI onboarding experience with Qlever.   Also visit the main
[qlever](https://github.com/ad-freiburg/qlever) repo or the [Qlever Wiki](https://github.com/ad-freiburg/qlever/wiki).

So why does this repo exist?   I wanted to play with ways to leverage deploying Qlever via
docker compose files for some of the workflows and automated approaches I have.   In that case, qlever-control
was not quite what I needed.  So we basically decomposed qlever-control logic into docker compose files.

This repo is for testing those approaches and ideas.

## What does this repo do?

If you are interested in deploying Qlever leveraging Docker Compose and data volumes or interfaces such
as Portainer.  This repository may provide some insight.   Or you may provide us some insight (ie, pull requests welcome)
